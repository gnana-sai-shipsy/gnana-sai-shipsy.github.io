# Tutorial: projectx

This project, *projectx*, acts like an **intelligent dispatcher** for deliveries.
Its core purpose is to automatically assign delivery tasks (*Consignments*) to the best available delivery personnel (*Workers*) within a specific area (*Hub*).
It uses a central **Orchestrator (Aster)** that considers rules like worker skills/vehicle types (using *Tags*), worker availability and ranking (*Prioritization*), task requirements, and location to make efficient assignments.
It also includes features for handling **configurations**, *reassigning* tasks if delays occur, and *grouping* nearby orders for efficiency.
