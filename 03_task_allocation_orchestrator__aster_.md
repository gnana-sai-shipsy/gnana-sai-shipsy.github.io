# Chapter 3: Task Allocation Orchestrator (Aster) - The Delivery Matchmaker

Welcome back! In [Chapter 1](01_ondemand_consignment_model.md), we met the `OndemandConsignment`, our digital work ticket for a single delivery. Then, in [Chapter 2](02_ondemand_worker_model.md), we met the `OndemandWorker`, the digital ID card for our delivery drivers.

Now, we have orders waiting and drivers available. How does the system automatically figure out the *best* driver for each order? That's the job of the **Task Allocation Orchestrator**, which we call **Aster**.

## What's the Big Idea? The Delivery Matchmaker

Imagine a busy pizza place on a Friday night. You have several pizzas ready for delivery (`OndemandConsignments`) and a few drivers (`OndemandWorkers`) waiting at the store. Who should take which pizza?

*   Driver A is on a bike, Driver B has a car. Pizza #1 is small, Pizza #2 is huge. Driver A can't take Pizza #2.
*   Pizza #3 needs to go downtown, Pizza #4 is nearby. Driver B is already heading downtown for another order. Maybe Driver B should take Pizza #3 too?
*   Driver C just finished a delivery and is heading back, but they're still 10 minutes away. Should we wait for them for Pizza #4, or give it to Driver A now?

Making these decisions quickly and efficiently is complex! That's where **Aster** comes in.

**Aster is the main coordinator or "brain" for assigning delivery tasks to available workers within a specific area (hub).** Think of it like an **air traffic controller** for deliveries, or maybe a super-smart **matchmaker** connecting orders with the best possible drivers based on a set of rules.

## What Does Aster Do? Step-by-Step

Aster runs periodically (like every minute) for each active hub (e.g., a specific restaurant or warehouse) to see if any tasks need assigning. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its process:

1.  **Gather Information:**
    *   **Find Pending Orders:** Aster looks for all `OndemandConsignments` in the hub that are waiting to be assigned (e.g., status is `unassigned`) or might need reassignment (more on that later).
    *   **Find Available Workers:** Aster finds all `OndemandWorkers` associated with the hub who are ready for work (e.g., status is `in_store`, meaning they are at the hub and available).

2.  **Apply Rules & Check Compatibility:**
    *   For each potential order-worker pair, Aster checks if they are compatible based on various rules (constraints):
        *   **Location:** Is the worker in the right place (e.g., at the hub)?
        *   **Skills/Tags:** Does the order require special handling ("fragile", "requires_car") that the worker possesses? We'll learn more about this in the [Constraint Tag System](04_constraint_tag_system.md).
        *   **Capacity:** Does the worker have enough space (weight/volume) left in their vehicle for this order? Do they already have too many orders?
        *   **Time Windows:** Can the worker realistically pick up and deliver the order within its required time window?
        *   **Worker Status:** Is the worker currently allowed to take new orders (e.g., not on break, not already heading out)?

3.  **Optimize (Optional but Powerful):**
    *   Just finding *compatible* workers isn't always enough. We want the *best* match.
    *   Aster can optionally send the list of eligible orders and available workers to an **external optimization engine**. This engine uses complex algorithms to figure out the most efficient assignments, considering things like:
        *   Minimizing total travel time/distance.
        *   Grouping orders together for a single worker (clubbing - see [Auto-Reassignment & Clubbing Logic](06_auto_reassignment___clubbing_logic.md)).
        *   Prioritizing certain orders or workers (see [Worker Prioritization Strategy](05_worker_prioritization_strategy.md)).
    *   The optimizer returns a plan: "Assign Order A to Worker 1", "Assign Order B and C to Worker 2".

4.  **Make the Assignment:**
    *   Based on the rules or the optimizer's plan, Aster performs the actual assignment.
    *   It uses the methods we saw in previous chapters:
        *   It calls the `assignToWorker` method on the chosen `OndemandConsignment` object.
        *   It calls the `assignOrders` (or similar methods) on the chosen `OndemandWorker` object.
    *   This links the order and worker together in the database and updates their statuses (e.g., order becomes `assigned_for_delivery`, worker becomes `in_store_assigned`).

5.  **Handle Failures (Dropped Tasks):**
    *   What if, after all checks, *no* suitable worker can be found for an order right now?
    *   Aster marks this task as "dropped" for this allocation cycle. It might be picked up in the next cycle when workers become available, or it might require manual intervention.

6.  **Handle Changes (Auto-Reassignment):**
    *   Sometimes, things go wrong *after* an assignment. A worker might get stuck in traffic and be severely delayed.
    *   Aster can detect these situations. If enabled, it might automatically unassign the delayed task and try to reassign it to a different worker who can deliver it faster. This is covered in more detail in [Auto-Reassignment & Clubbing Logic](06_auto_reassignment___clubbing_logic.md).

## Using Aster (Code Examples)

You typically don't call Aster directly for a single order. Instead, it's run automatically for an entire hub. The main function is `asterTaskAllocation`.

**1. Running Aster for a Hub**

Imagine a background script that runs every minute. For each active hub, it calls Aster.

```javascript
// Import the main Aster function
const { asterTaskAllocation } = require('../../../models/internal-api-parts/jfl-parts/aster-task-allocation');
// Assume setup for database connection (extendedModels) and organisation details

const hubIdToProcess = 'HUB001'; // The specific restaurant/warehouse
const organisationId = 'YOUR_ORG_ID';

async function runAllocationForHub() {
    console.log(`Running Aster for Hub: ${hubIdToProcess}`);
    try {
        // Call the main Aster orchestrator function
        const result = await asterTaskAllocation(
            {
                hub_id: hubIdToProcess,
                organisation_id: organisationId,
                // Other parameters might be passed based on configuration
            },
            { /* Request context (req) */ },
            { /* Response context (res) */ }
        );
        console.log(`Aster run complete for ${hubIdToProcess}. Success: ${result.success}`);
        // Aster handles finding orders, workers, and assigning internally.
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Aster failed for Hub ${hubIdToProcess}:`, error);
        // Log the error, maybe retry later
    }
}

// Example: Run allocation now
runAllocationForHub();
```

This code simply tells Aster: "Hey, do your magic for Hub `HUB001`". Aster takes care of the rest internally.

**2. Inside Aster: Fetching Data (Conceptual)**

Aster needs to get the lists of pending orders and available workers. It uses SQL queries for this.

```javascript
// --- Inside asterTaskAllocation (Simplified Concept) ---

// 1. Fetch Pending Orders (Consignments) for the Hub
const pendingOrdersQuery = `
    SELECT reference_number, status, weight, /* other details */
    FROM consignment
    WHERE hub_id = $1 AND status = 'unassigned'
    AND eligible_for_auto_allocation = true
    /* ... other conditions like time ... */
`;
// const pendingOrders = await database.query(pendingOrdersQuery, [hubId]);
// Result: List of orders like { reference_number: 'ORDER123', status: 'unassigned', ... }

// 2. Fetch Available Workers for the Hub
const availableWorkersQuery = `
    SELECT worker.id, worker.worker_code, worker.current_status, vehicle.vehicle_category_id
    FROM worker
    JOIN hubworkerrelation ON worker.id = hubworkerrelation.worker_id
    LEFT JOIN vehicle ON worker.vehicle_id = vehicle.id
    WHERE hubworkerrelation.hub_id = $1 AND worker.current_status = 'in_store'
    /* ... other conditions like not on break ... */
`;
// const availableWorkers = await database.query(availableWorkersQuery, [hubId]);
// Result: List of workers like { id: 'w1', worker_code: 'W001', current_status: 'in_store', vehicle_type: 'bike', ... }

console.log(`Found ${pendingOrders.length} orders and ${availableWorkers.length} workers.`);
```

This shows the *idea* of fetching the necessary data. The actual queries (like `getNewConsignmentQuery` and `availabeWorkerQuery` in `aster-task-allocation.js`) are more complex to handle various configurations and edge cases.

**3. Inside Aster: Assigning a Task (Conceptual)**

After the optimizer (or internal logic) decides "Assign ORDER123 to W001", Aster uses the `assignTaskToWorker` helper function (also in `aster-task-allocation.js`). This function, in turn, uses the objects we learned about.

```javascript
// --- Inside assignTaskToWorker (Simplified Concept) ---
// Assume we decided to assign taskList = [{ reference_number: 'ORDER123', type: 'delivery' }]
// to worker = { worker_id: 'w1', worker_code: 'W001' }

const OndemandWorker = require('../../../domain-models/ondemand-handler/ondemand-worker-class/ondemand-worker-class');
const OndemandConsignment = require('../../../domain-models/ondemand-handler/ondemand-consignment-class/ondemand-consignment-class');

async function performAssignment(workerInfo, taskInfo) {
    // Start a database transaction for safety
    // const transaction = await database.beginTransaction();
    try {
        // 1. Load the worker object
        const odw = new OndemandWorker({ /* setup */ });
        await odw.initializeWorkerById({ workerId: workerInfo.worker_id }, { transaction });

        // 2. Load the consignment object
        const odc = new OndemandConsignment({ /* setup */ });
        await odc.initializeConsignmentByReferenceNumber(
             { referenceNumber: taskInfo.reference_number }, { transaction }
        );

        // 3. Perform Validations (Can worker take this task? Is task still available?)
        // await odw.validateWorkerForAssign({}, { transaction });
        // await odw.validateConsignmentForWorker({ requiredConsignment: odc.requiredConsignment }, { transaction });

        // 4. Use the consignment object to assign it to the worker
        await odc.assignToWorker({
            workerId: odw.requiredWorker.id,
            eventTime: new Date(),
            currentTime: new Date(),
            // ... other details ...
        }, { transaction });

        // 5. Update worker status if needed (e.g., from 'in_store' to 'in_store_assigned')
        if (odw.requiredWorker.current_status === 'in_store') {
            await odw.requiredWorker.updateAttributes(
                { current_status: 'in_store_assigned' }, { transaction }
            );
        }

        // If all ok, commit the transaction
        // await database.commit(transaction);
        console.log(`Successfully assigned ${taskInfo.reference_number} to ${workerInfo.worker_code}`);

    } catch (error) {
        // If anything failed, rollback the transaction
        // await database.rollback(transaction);
        console.error(`Failed to assign: ${error.message}`);
        // This task might be marked as "dropped" for this cycle
    }
}

// Example call
// performAssignment({ worker_id: 'w1', worker_code: 'W001' }, { reference_number: 'ORDER123', type: 'delivery' });
```

This simplified flow shows how Aster orchestrates the assignment by using the `OndemandWorker` and `OndemandConsignment` objects to handle the database updates and state changes correctly within a transaction.

## Under the Hood: How Aster Makes Decisions

Let's visualize the core flow when Aster runs for a hub:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CronJob as Background Script
    participant Aster as Aster (asterTaskAllocation)
    participant DB as Database
    participant Optimizer as Optimization Engine (Optional)
    participant ODW as OndemandWorker Object
    participant ODC as OndemandConsignment Object

    CronJob->>Aster: Run for Hub 'HUB001'
    Aster->>DB: Fetch Pending Consignments (WHERE hub_id='HUB001' AND status='unassigned')
    DB-->>Aster: List of Consignments (e.g., CN1, CN2)
    Aster->>DB: Fetch Available Workers (WHERE hub_id='HUB001' AND status='in_store')
    DB-->>Aster: List of Workers (e.g., W1, W2)

    Note over Aster: Apply basic rules (capacity, vehicle type etc.)

    alt Optimization Enabled
        Aster->>Optimizer: Send eligible Consignments (CN1, CN2) and Workers (W1, W2)
        Optimizer-->>Aster: Assignment Plan (e.g., Assign CN1 to W1, Assign CN2 to W2)
    else Basic Logic
        Note over Aster: Use simpler logic (e.g., first-come, first-served matching)
        Note over Aster: Decide: Assign CN1 to W1, Assign CN2 to W2
    end

    Note over Aster: For each assignment (e.g., CN1 -> W1):
    Aster->>ODC: Initialize for CN1
    Aster->>ODW: Initialize for W1
    Aster->>ODC: assignToWorker(workerId=W1.id)
    ODC->>DB: Update Consignment (status='assigned', trip_id=...)
    ODC->>ODW: (Inform worker object, potentially update status)
    ODW->>DB: Update Worker (status='in_store_assigned')
    DB-->>Aster: Assignment Success/Failure

    Aster-->>CronJob: Run Complete (Success/Failure)

```

**Code Location:**

The primary logic for Aster resides in:
`common/models/internal-api-parts/jfl-parts/aster-task-allocation.js`

Inside this file, you'll find:

*   `asterTaskAllocation`: The main function that orchestrates the entire process for a hub.
*   `getHubsForAsterTaskAllocation`: Finds which hubs have pending work and need Aster to run.
*   `getNewConsignmentQuery` / `availabeWorkerQuery`: (Inside `asterTaskAllocation`) The SQL queries to fetch data.
*   `transformCnToAllocator`: Prepares consignment data into a format the optimizer understands.
*   Helper functions for calling the optimizer (`callOptimizerAPI`) and processing results.
*   `assignTaskToWorker`: Handles the actual assignment logic using `OndemandWorker` and `OndemandConsignment` objects.

Other important related files:

*   `common/domain-models/ondemand-handler/task-allocation/tag-utils.js`: Functions for handling constraint tags during matching (`isWorkerConstraintTagCompatibleWithCn`).
*   `common/domain-models/ondemand-handler/task-allocation/prioritise-workers.js`: Logic for sorting and prioritizing workers before sending them to the optimizer (`prioritiseWorkersList`).
*   `common/models/internal-api-parts/jfl-parts/auto-reassignment-utils.js`: Contains logic for checking if a task needs reassignment.

## Conclusion

You've now learned about **Aster**, the central brain or "matchmaker" of our on-demand delivery system. It's responsible for the complex task of automatically assigning pending delivery orders (`OndemandConsignments`) to the best available `OndemandWorkers` based on a variety of rules, constraints, and potentially optimization logic. It brings together the concepts from Chapters 1 and 2 to make the system operate efficiently.

One of the key ways Aster matches orders and workers is by using **tags** to represent requirements and capabilities. In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into this powerful feature: [Constraint Tag System](04_constraint_tag_system.md).
